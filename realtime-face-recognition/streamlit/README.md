# Deploying a Streamlit Image-Management Dashboard

Perform the following steps to deploy an interactive [Streamlit](Streamlit) dashboard for classifying (labeling) and browsing collected images in your Iguazio Data Science Platform (**"the platform"**) environment:

1. On you platform, launch a Jupyter Notebook service, navigate to "demos/realtime-face-recognition/streamlit" and locate the file **streamlit.yaml**

2. right click on **streamlit.yaml** and select Download

4. Ensure that you have a trained model, generated by using the [face-recognition.ipynb](notebooks/face-recognition.ipynb) demo notebook.

5. Run the following command from a command-line shell on your local computer to deploy the Streamlit dashboard as a service; ensure that the current directory has your **streamlit.yaml** file that you have downloaded or change the path (`-f`) to point to your file:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n default-tenant apply -f streamlit.yaml
   ```

   > **Note:** To successfully run this `kubectl` command you need a **kubeconfig** file with the required permissions.
   > Contact [Iguazio support](mailto:support@iguazio.com) for assistance.

6. In your web browser, go to port 30090 of your platform's application node &mdash; `<your platform application-node IP address>:30090` &mdash; and view your interactive Streamlit dashboard:
